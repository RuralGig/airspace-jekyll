# Privacy Policy
This privacy notice discloses the privacy practices for Rural Gig, Wireless ISP.

## Your Account
Your account information will be kept strictly confidential, and will not be shared with any third party without your explicit consent.

Wherever we collect sensitive information (such as credit card data), that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a lock icon in the address bar and looking for "https" at the beginning of the address of the Web page.

While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.

## Internet Usage
We will not track the internet traffic of any individual user, unless that user is engaged in actvities
that negatively affect the network stability and throughput. In those occasions, we may single out the 
individual client radio for analysis to identify the cause of the problem. 

We will track internet usage at an aggregate system level to ensure the system is operating normally,
and we have sufficient capacity to deliver a quality service. We will gather metrics on video streaming usage,
and general web site usage, to ensure we expand our bandwidth as needed.

## FCC Regulations
As an ISP, we are required to provide to the FCC quarterly reports of demographic information about our
clients that are using the system. No personally identifiable information is provided above number of users, 
their overall location, and our overall system usage.

## Contact
If you feel that we are not abiding by this privacy policy, you should contact us immediately
via telephone at 222-333-4444 or via email.
