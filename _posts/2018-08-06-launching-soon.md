## Aug 6, 9:00am

Equipment is scheduled to be installed on the tower on August 16.

We will need about 30 days after that to test out the equipment, secure the network, and ensure
everything is working. We will also run some real world tests at a few select locations.

We will be adding new customer shortly thereafter.

We are almost there!
