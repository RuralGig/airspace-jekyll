All the equipment has been installed on the tower. We are still waiting for our electrical inspection
and for the fiber to be turned on. Once the system is activated, we will spend the next week testing
and configuring the system.

We hope to start bringing customers online soon. We will work through the list of service requests in the
order we have received them. And you should be hearing from us soon.

We are very excited to turn this system on, and look forward to working with all that have expressed interest.
